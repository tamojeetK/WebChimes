*Kalimba* is a musical instrument that consists of a wooden board or a box resonator with metal tines attached to it. The tines are plucked with the thumbs or fingers to produce a melodic and soothing sound. Kalimba is also known as a thumb piano, a finger harp, or a sansa.

Kalimba is a modern instrument that was designed by Hugh Tracey, an English ethnomusicologist, in the 1950s. He based it on the Mbira, an ancient instrument from Zimbabwe, and popularized it worldwide. Kalimba has a Western scale that follows the seven-note diatonic scale used in Western music. The notes on the Kalimba are usually tuned to C major, G major, or F major, but they can also be tuned to other scales.

Kalimba is easy to play and can be used for various purposes, such as meditation, relaxation, entertainment, education, and therapy. Kalimba can also be combined with other instruments or vocals to create different genres of music, such as folk, pop, jazz, classical, and more.

## üñáÔ∏èKalimba's connection with Mbira

Kalimba is connected to Mbira in many ways, as they are both musical instruments that belong to
the lamellaphone family, which means they have metal or bamboo tongues that are plucked
to produce sound. However, they have some differences in their origin, design, tuning,
and sound.

- Origin: Mbira is an ancient instrument that originated in Zimbabwe over a thousand years ago. It is also known as a thumb piano or a finger harp. Kalimba is a modern instrument that was designed by Hugh Tracey, an English ethnomusicologist, in the 1950s. He based it on the Mbira and popularized it worldwide.
- Design: Mbira usually has two rows of metal tines that are mounted on a wooden board or a gourd resonator. The tines are arranged in a non-linear order and can vary in number and layout. Mbira also has a machachara, which is a device that produces a buzzing sound when the tines are plucked. Kalimba has a single row of metal tines that are mounted on a wooden board or a box resonator. The tines are arranged in a linear order and usually have 10, 15, or 17 notes. Kalimba does not have a machachara, but some models have holes on the resonator that can create a wah-wah effect  .
- Tuning: Mbira has a non-Western scale that does not follow the typical seven-note diatonic scale used in Western music. The notes on the Mbira can vary depending on the region, tradition, or personal preference of the player. Some notes may be missing or repeated on the Mbira. Kalimba has a Western scale that follows the seven-note diatonic scale used in Western music. The notes on the Kalimba are usually tuned to C major, G major, or F major, but they can also be tuned to other scales  .
- Sound: Mbira has a deep and rich sound that is enhanced by the buzzing of the machachara. The sound of the Mbira is considered to be spiritual and ancestral by the Shona people of Zimbabwe, who use it for religious ceremonies and rituals. Kalimba has a sweet and melodic sound that is influenced by the wah-wah effect of the holes on the resonator. The sound of the Kalimba is considered to be soothing and relaxing by many people who use it for meditation and entertainment  .
